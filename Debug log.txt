RTC Module:

Problem description:
    Completed I2C Setting from CUBEMX. Correctly set I2C pins. But no RTC data come from module.
Debug process:
    1. double check pinout. double check datasheet, make sure device address is correct. still fail.
    2. modify my function, try to see if returned value is HAL_BUSY or HAL_ERROR. it returned "HAL_ERROR".
    3. Look into source code, compare with I2C sample code, also did some google. Found that there is no GPIO setting for I2C even I set pinout correctly from CUBEMX. Now manually add GPIO setting in MX_GPIO_Init. still return "HAL_ERROR".
    4. Create a new project with only I2C setting and UART2. Place GPIO setting into GPIO init then try. Return "HAL_ERROR". Place setting into I2C init function then try, return "HAL_ERROR".
    5. Check RTC module voltage. 5V power supply, SDA and SCL are both around 1 V.
    6. Googled, find it need to shift address to the left. modify "RTC_ADDR" to "RTC_ADDR<<1". Works!
